2.Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to 2019 in order to better understand:

.What programming languages are on the rise during the previous three years?

.How does the education level affects the salary, job and career satisfaction?


.Does the number of people who desire to work in a particular language accurately predicts its rise in the following year?

.What does the developers in general think of higher management?

3.File Description 
You can get the file from Stock Overflow data site.

4.Result

.After doing the analysis it shows that Java, JavaScript and C are clearly the top languages developers preferred during these years.

.higher degree, i.e, a doctoral degree has the highest positive effect on all three areas. Similarly, all the degrees resulted in a positive effect on all three with the exception a Professional degree which resulted in a negative effect on all three of them. Having a master’s degree seemed to have negligible effect on salary.

.It gives an idea of what developers would want to try, there are most certainly other factors to keep into account like the market, the developers’ organizations and so on.

5.Conclusion:

In this article, we analyzed the Stackoverflow’s Developers’ Data from the years 2017 to 2019. Following are the major insights that can be concluded from the analysis:

C, Java and JavaScript are the most popular languages among developers during these years. Python is one of the few languages that is becoming increasingly popular among the developers.

Doctoral degrees lead to a better salary, job and career satisfaction and while it’s possible to earn a good salary without any formal education, it does effect the job and career satisfaction negatively.

The desire of a developer to work in a particular language has little effect on its popularity in the next year.
